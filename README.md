## <span role="img" aria-label="graph">üìä</span> Burndown chart, on Todoist

Work with all your Todoist apps as always, but be more productivity than never before.  
Know how far you are from yor expectative and plan your personal life much better. Work seamlessly at the office, with the same tool you do on your home. Boost your personal productivity like a Pro, and manage your work with the calm of a Tibetan monk.

## <span role="img" aria-label="padlock">üîê</span> Nobody will know that you are procrastinating

BurndownChartist is as secure as it should be. We do not send your data through Internet, so nobody (not even us) will read your Todoist data. Everything is stored and processed on your browser and is not shared with nobody else than you. We don't work with accounts and passwords, but with your Todoist token, so it's really secure.

## <span role="img" aria-label="gear">‚öôÔ∏è</span> Even more useful than hard to spell

With BurndownChartist, you can check how many hours or minutes you worked each day, export the burndown chart to a file and show off with your friends about who is the most productivity creature alive. It's weird but we know you do it.

## <span role="img" aria-label="hands">üëê</span> _Open_ stands for _Oooh :3_

This is an open source project by [Mario Varona](https://www.github.com/mvarona) with [MIT license](https://github.com/mvarona/BurndownChartist/blob/master/LICENSE), that means that anyone can improve it so that we all live in a more productive world. And by the way, it's completely free.
