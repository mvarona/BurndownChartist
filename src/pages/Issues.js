            <p>
                BurndownChartist is not perfect but I haven't tested it as deep as it would be desirable, so many wild bugs are very likely to appear. If you encouter one, please <a href="mailto:m.varona@bmsalamanca.com?subject=Bug%20found%20on%20BurndownChartist">
                    let me know
                </a>{' '} so I could list them here and they could be fixed soon. Thanks for your understanding!
